## 🚀 Features

- **Simple Interface**: Minimalistic and user-friendly design
- **Hardware ID Spoofing**: Modify various hardware identifiers
- **Registry Modification**: Change hardware-related registry entries
- **Volume ID Spoofing**: Alter disk volume identifiers
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage
- **Easy to Use**: One-click spoofing functionality

## 🔧 How It Works

The spoofer modifies various Windows system identifiers including:
- Hardware IDs in Windows Registry
- Disk Volume Serial Numbers
- System Hardware Information
- Network Adapter MAC Addresses
- Motherboard Serial Numbers

## 📋 Requirements

- Windows 7/8/10/11 (32-bit or 64-bit)
- Administrator privileges
- .NET Framework (if applicable)

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Launch the application as Administrator
2. Click the "Spoof" button to randomize hardware IDs
3. Restart your computer for changes to take effect

### Advanced Usage
- Select specific components to spoof
- Choose custom values instead of random generation
- Preview changes before applying them

## ⚙️ What Gets Spoofed

- **Disk IDs**: Hard drive serial numbers and volume IDs
- **Registry Entries**: Hardware-related registry keys
- **System Information**: Motherboard and CPU identifiers
- **Network**: MAC addresses (if supported)
- **Installation ID**: Windows installation identifiers

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Antivirus Detection**: Some antivirus software may flag this as suspicious
- **System Stability**: Always create a system restore point before use
- **Legal Compliance**: Only use on systems you own or have permission to modify
- **Backup**: Keep backups of original hardware IDs if needed

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Administrator Rights**: Must be run as Administrator to modify system files
- **Restart Required**: Computer restart is required for changes to take effect
- **Temporary Changes**: Some changes may be temporary and reset after updates
- **Compatibility**: Tested on Windows 10/11, may work on older versions

## 🛡️ Antivirus & Detection

This tool modifies system files and registry entries, which may trigger antivirus software. This is normal behavior for HWID spoofers. To use:

1. Add the executable to your antivirus whitelist
2. Temporarily disable real-time protection
3. Run the tool and re-enable protection

## 🔄 Reverting Changes

To revert changes:
1. Use Windows System Restore to a point before spoofing
2. Manually restore registry backups (if created)
3. Some changes may require Windows reinstallation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Access Denied" Error**
- Solution: Run as Administrator

**Changes Don't Take Effect**
- Solution: Restart your computer

**Antivirus Blocks Execution**
- Solution: Add to whitelist or temporarily disable

**System Instability**
- Solution: Use System Restore to revert changes
